Description: A generic reference Bayesian analysis of unidimensional mixture distributions obtained by a location-scale parameterisation of the model is implemented. The including functions simulate and summarize posterior samples for location-scale mixture models using a weakly informative prior. There is no need to define priors for scale-location parameters except two hyperparameters in which are associated with a Dirichlet prior for weights and a simplex.
